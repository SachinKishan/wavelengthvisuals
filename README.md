# wavelengthvisuals

A simple color data visualiser which takes wavelength values, converts it into CIE XYZ 1931 color space and then converts that into sRGB color space and displays it on the screen. 

It's very limited right now since I'm only taking integer wavelength values as input so it's not a very varied color pallette.
